  - reducers/     -- Collection of every domain's redux reducers
  - normalization -- bridge nested json-objects to normalized in-state struct.
  - store         -- There should only ever be one redux store. It lives here.
- *DomainWidgets/ -- The specific react domains
  - actions/      -- Redux action definitions
  - components/   -- "Dumb" components that contain markup
  - containers/   -- "Smart" components that contain logic

../components.js  -- The react setup file for both the client-facing asset
                     pipeline and the server-side rendering engine.
                     Requires necessary libraries and sets up globals for
                     react-rails' server rendering
